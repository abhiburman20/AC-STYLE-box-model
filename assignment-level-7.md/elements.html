                Machine Learning involves the use of Artificial Intelligence to enable machines to learn a task
                from experience without programming them specifically about that task. (In short, Machines learn

                Robotics is a field that deals with creating humanoid machines that can behave like humans and perform 
                some actions like human beings. Now, robots can act like humans in certain situations but can they think
                like humans as well? This is where artificial intelligence comes in! AI allows robots to act intelligently 
                in certain situations. These robots may be able to solve problems in a limited sphere or even learn in 
                controlled environments.

                Artificial Intelligence deals with the creation of systems that can learn to emulate human tasks using their prior experience
                 and without any manual intervention. Internet of Things, on the other hand, is a network of various devices that are connected 
                  over the internet and they can collect and exchange data with each other.
